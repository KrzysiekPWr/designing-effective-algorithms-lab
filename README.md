# ATSP Student Projects Summary  

## 1. Solving with Brute Force, Dynamic Programming and Branch & Bound (Exact Algorithms)  
This project focuses on determining the largest ATSP instance that can be solved within a 2-minute time limit. It employs exact algorithms, including **Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, and Branch & Bound**, to measure their efficiency and scalability. The results highlight the computational limits of each approach and provide insights into their practical applications.

## 2. Solving with Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing (Heuristic Algorithms)  
This project evaluates the **smallest relative error** achievable by heuristic approaches when solving ATSP instances. The algorithms used include **Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing**, both known for balancing solution quality and computational time. The study analyzes how different problem instances impact the accuracy of these heuristics and identifies their strengths and weaknesses.

## 3. Solving using Genetic Algorithm
This project examines the performance of a **Genetic Algorithm** in solving ATSP instances by analyzing the **smallest relative error across the entire population**. The study explores how varying algorithm parameters (e.g., mutation rate, selection method, population size) influence solution quality. The results provide insights into optimizing genetic algorithms for ATSP and improving convergence rates.
